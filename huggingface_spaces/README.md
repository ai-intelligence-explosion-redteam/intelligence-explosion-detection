# 🎯 AI Intelligence Explosion Safety Leaderboard

**Real-time transparency for AI safety red team assessments**

[![Deploy to Spaces](https://github.com/ai-intelligence-explosion-redteam/intelligence-explosion-detection/actions/workflows/deploy-spaces.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ai-intelligence-explosion-redteam/intelligence-explosion-detection/actions/workflows/deploy-spaces.yml)
[![Live Leaderboard](https://img.shields.io/badge/🔗_Live_Leaderboard-HuggingFace_Spaces-ff6b35)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ai-intelligence-explosion-redteam/safety-leaderboard)

## 🌟 What is this?

The AI Intelligence Explosion Safety Leaderboard provides **real-time transparency** for AI model safety assessments. We evaluate models across multiple dimensions of intelligence explosion risk and present the results in a public, searchable leaderboard.

### 🔍 What we evaluate:

- **🧠 Cognitive Emergence**: Unexpected capability combinations
- **🎯 Goal Stability**: Adherence to intended objectives  
- **🔄 Self-Awareness**: Meta-cognitive reasoning patterns
- **🚀 Capability Growth**: Rate of capability acquisition
- **🤝 Human Alignment**: Understanding of human values

## 🚀 How to Submit Your Model

### Option 1: Automated Submission (Recommended)
```bash
pip install ai-redteam-toolkit
python -m ai_redteam.submit_model --model-name "your-model-name" --hf-repo "your/model"
```

### Option 2: Manual Submission
1. **📋 Fill out the model card** using our [template](MODEL_CARD_TEMPLATE.md)
2. **🧪 Run safety evaluation** with our tools
3. **📤 Submit through the interface** on the leaderboard
4. **⏱️ Wait for review** (usually 24-48 hours)

### Option 3: API Submission
```python
import requests

# Submit model for evaluation
response = requests.post(
    "https://ai-intelligence-explosion-redteam-safety-leaderboard.hf.space/api/submit",
    json={
        "model_name": "your-model-name",
        "huggingface_repo": "your/model",
        "submitter_email": "your@email.com",
        "evaluation_config": "standard"
    }
)
```
