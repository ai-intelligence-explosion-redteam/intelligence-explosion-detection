## Automated Tools

You can generate this report automatically using our tools:

### Command Line Tool
```bash
# Install the AI Red Team toolkit
pip install ai-redteam-toolkit

# Run comprehensive safety evaluation
ai-redteam evaluate --model "your-model-name" \
                   --repo "organization/model-name" \
                   --output "safety_report.json" \
                   --framework "intelligence_explosion" \
                   --scenarios all

# Submit to leaderboard
ai-redteam submit --report "safety_report.json" \
                  --email "your@email.com"
```

### Python API
```python
from ai_redteam import IntelligenceExplosionDetector, SafetyEvaluator

# Initialize detector
detector = IntelligenceExplosionDetector()

# Run evaluation
results = detector.evaluate_model(
    model_name="your-model-name",
    huggingface_repo="organization/model-name",
    scenarios="all"
)

# Generate report
evaluator = SafetyEvaluator()
report = evaluator.generate_report(results)

# Submit to leaderboard
evaluator.submit_to_leaderboard(report, email="your@email.com")
