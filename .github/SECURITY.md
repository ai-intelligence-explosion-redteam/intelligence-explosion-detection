# Security Policy for AI Intelligence Explosion Detection Red Team

## üõ°Ô∏è Responsible Disclosure Policy

We take security seriously and appreciate the efforts of security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities. This policy outlines our Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) process.

### Scope

This policy applies to vulnerabilities in:
- Intelligence explosion detection algorithms
- Red team testing frameworks  
- Monitoring and alerting systems
- Compliance management tools
- AI model interaction components

### Reporting Security Issues

**üö® CRITICAL: Do NOT open public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, please use one of these secure channels:

#### Primary Contact
- **Email**: security@ai-redteam.org (PGP key available)
- **Signal**: +1-XXX-XXX-XXXX (for urgent issues)

#### Secondary Contact  
- **Encrypted Form**: https://ai-redteam.org/security-report
- **GitHub Security Advisories**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting

### What to Include

Please provide as much information as possible:

1. **Vulnerability Description**
   - Type of vulnerability (injection, bypass, etc.)
   - Components affected
   - Potential impact assessment

2. **Reproduction Steps**
   - Detailed steps to reproduce
   - Sample inputs/prompts (safely sanitized)
   - Expected vs actual behavior

3. **Impact Assessment**
   - Risk level (using our RiskLevel enum)
   - Potential for intelligence explosion indicators
   - Affected AI safety mechanisms

4. **Suggested Mitigation**
   - Proposed fixes or workarounds
   - Additional safety measures

### CVD Timeline

Our standard disclosure timeline follows industry best practices:

| Day | Activity |
|-----|----------|
| 0 | Vulnerability reported |
| 1 | Acknowledgment sent to reporter |
| 2-3 | Initial assessment and vendor notification |
| 7 | Assessment complete, response plan created |
| 30 | Target date for patch release |
| 31 | Public disclosure (if patch available) |

#### Emergency Timeline

For **EXPLOSIVE** or **CRITICAL** risk vulnerabilities:
- **Immediate**: Emergency response team activated
- **4 hours**: Initial containment measures
- **24 hours**: Emergency patch or mitigation
- **48 hours**: Coordinated public disclosure

### What We Do

When you report a vulnerability:

1. **Acknowledgment**: We'll confirm receipt within 24 hours
2. **Assessment**: Our security team evaluates the issue
3. **Coordination**: We notify affected parties (model developers, platforms)
4. **Development**: We work on fixes and mitigations  
5. **Testing**: Patches undergo rigorous AI safety testing
6. **Disclosure**: We coordinate public disclosure

### Recognition

We believe in recognizing security researchers:

- **Public Recognition**: Listed in our security hall of fame
- **CVE Assignment**: Help with CVE registration when applicable
- **Conference Opportunities**: Speaking opportunities at AI safety events
- **Research Collaboration**: Potential for joint research publications

### Legal Safe Harbor

We provide legal safe harbor for security research conducted in good faith:

- Testing is limited to systems you own or have permission to test
- You don't access or modify data belonging to others
- You don't disrupt our services or other users
- You make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations

### Out of Scope

The following are **NOT** covered by this policy:

- Social engineering attacks against our team
- Physical attacks against infrastructure
- Attacks requiring physical access to devices
- Denial of service attacks
- Spam or social engineering content

### AI-Specific Considerations

Given our focus on AI safety, please note:

#### Responsible AI Testing
- **Do not** attempt to create actually harmful content
- **Do not** try to cause real-world harm through AI systems
- **Use** our provided testing frameworks and sandboxes
- **Report** any signs of actual intelligence explosion immediately

#### Sensitive Prompts
- Hash or mask any potentially dangerous prompts
- Provide reproduction steps without revealing exact attack vectors
- Use our secure channels for sensitive information

#### Model Interaction Ethics
- Respect rate limits and usage policies of AI services
- Don't attempt to extract training data
- Report capability discoveries responsibly

### Emergency Response

For **EXPLOSIVE** risk level findings:

1. **Immediate Notification**: Call our emergency hotline
2. **Containment**: We may implement immediate safety measures
3. **Coordination**: Alert relevant AI safety organizations
4. **Public Safety**: Consider immediate public warnings if needed

### Contact Information

- **Primary**: security@ai-redteam.org
- **Emergency**: +1-XXX-XXX-XXXX (24/7 monitored)
- **PGP Key**: Available at https://ai-redteam.org/pgp
- **GitHub**: @ai-redteam-security

### Compliance

This policy aligns with:
- EU AI Act incident reporting requirements
- NIST AI Risk Management Framework
- Bletchley Declaration principles
- ISO/IEC 23053 AI risk management standards
