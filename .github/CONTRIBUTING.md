- Familiarity with responsible disclosure

### Development Setup

```bash
# Fork the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ai-intelligence-explosion-redteam.git
cd ai-intelligence-explosion-redteam

# Set up environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Set up pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install

# Set Python path
export PYTHONPATH="."  # Linux/Mac
# or
$env:PYTHONPATH="."  # Windows PowerShell

# Run tests to verify setup
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

## 📝 Development Workflow

### 1. Issue Creation
- Check existing issues first
- Use appropriate issue templates
- Provide clear, detailed descriptions
- Tag with relevant labels

### 2. Branch Strategy
```bash
# Create feature branch from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Or for bug fixes
git checkout -b fix/bug-description

# Or for security fixes
git checkout -b security/vulnerability-fix
```

### 3. Code Standards

#### Python Style
- Follow PEP 8
- Use type hints
- Write docstrings for all functions
- Maximum line length: 100 characters

#### AI Safety Guidelines
- **Never include raw harmful prompts** in code or comments
- **Hash or mask sensitive content** using SHA256
- **Implement safety checks** for all AI interactions
- **Document security implications** of changes

#### Testing Requirements
- Write tests for all new functionality
- Maintain >80% code coverage
- Include edge cases and error conditions
- Test security implications

```python
# Example: Proper way to handle sensitive prompts
def test_harmful_pattern_detection():
    """Test detection of harmful patterns without exposing them"""
    # Use hashed or masked test data
    test_prompt_hash = "a1b2c3d4e5f6..."  # SHA256 of actual prompt
    masked_prompt = "MASKED_HARMFUL_CONTENT_001"
    
    result = detector.analyze_pattern(masked_prompt)
    assert result.risk_level >= RiskLevel.CONCERNING
```

### 4. Commit Guidelines

```bash
# Commit message format
type(scope): brief description

# Examples
feat(detector): add meta-cognitive awareness detection
fix(monitoring): resolve dashboard refresh issue
security(compliance): patch CVE-2024-XXXX
docs(readme): update installation instructions
test(integration): add multi-model testing

# Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, security
```
