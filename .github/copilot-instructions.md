<!-- Use this file to provide workspace-specific custom instructions to Copilot. For more details, visit https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#_use-a-githubcopilotinstructionsmd-file -->

## Project Overview
This is an AI Red Team project specialized in detecting intelligence explosion, emergent phenomena, and goal drift in large language models and multimodal AI systems.

## Core Principles
- **Transparency**: All methodologies and findings are open and reproducible
- **Safety First**: Detect dangerous capabilities before they cause harm  
- **International Compliance**: Adhere to EU AI Act, NIST RMF, and global AI safety standards
- **Dual-use Minimization**: Prevent misuse while enabling legitimate safety research

## Key Components
1. **Emergence Detection**: Monitor for unexpected capability combinations and novel problem-solving approaches
2. **Goal Drift Analysis**: Track deviations from intended objectives and unauthorized sub-goal creation
3. **Meta-cognitive Assessment**: Evaluate self-awareness, self-improvement attempts, and human relationship understanding
4. **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous surveillance with immediate alerting for critical risks
5. **Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure**: 30-day responsible disclosure process for discovered vulnerabilities

## Technical Guidelines
- Use PyRIT framework for red team automation
- Integrate HuggingFace models and evaluation frameworks
- Implement SHA256 hashing for sensitive prompt masking
- Follow MIT + RAIL dual licensing for ethical use
- Maintain EU AI Act Annex III risk classification compliance

## Development Standards
- All code must include comprehensive safety checks
- Implement multi-layer validation for AI outputs
- Use type hints and comprehensive documentation
- Include automated testing for all safety-critical components
- Maintain audit trails for all model interactions

## Security Considerations
- Never expose raw adversarial prompts publicly
- Implement proper access controls for sensitive components
- Use secure communication channels for vulnerability reports
- Maintain encrypted storage for sensitive research data
